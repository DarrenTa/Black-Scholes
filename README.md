The prompt used was:

>Produce a python function that evaluates the Black-Scholes formula.

The notes after providing the function were:

>This function calculates the price of a European call or put option using the Black-Scholes formula. It uses the norm.cdf function from the scipy.stats module, which provides the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, necessary for computing ( N(d_1) ) and ( N(d_2) ). Adjust the parameters according to the specific requirements and constraints of your financial model or market conditions.
